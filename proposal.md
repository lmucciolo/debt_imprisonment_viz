*I am between two project ideas, one has cleaned data but has already been widely published, including an [article on visualizations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/28/us/migrants-children-data.html) of the data, while the other is more novel but would require more cleaning.*

## Option 1: Court Debt Jailings

### Project Description 
A description of your subject area of choice. (1-2 paragraphs)

### Data Sources
My main data source comes from the reproduction materials for "Forgotten but not gone: A multi-state analysis of modern-day debt imprisonment" paper ([Github](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/debt), [website](https://policylab.hks.harvard.edu/debtors-prisons/)). The authors provide R/Python code to download the data bulk and tutorials on how to recreate the findings. The datasets include individual jail booking information from counties across Texas and Wisconsin. The datasets indicate (where available) each arrestee’s race, ethnicity, sex, age, state, ZIP code, booking date, release date, and release type, as well as each charge’s description, severity, and whether it represents a “failure to pay". There are about 4 million observations split across both states.

### Questions

* Should I limit my project to just one state, or would the work be more powerful by including both states?
* Is it worth adding additional information on demographics (using data from the census)?

## Option 2: Unaccompanied Migrant Children

### Project Description 
Unaccompanied child migrants are children or adolescents who enter the US without a legal guardian and legal immigration documents. Over the last 10 years, there has been a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border, especially those coming from Central and South America. Once they reach the US their [ADD MORE]


In 2023, the New York Times published a series of articles detailing the reach of migrant child labor across the US. The author (Hannah Dreier) collected data from the Department of Health and Human Services through FOIA requests to help find locations in the US with high concentrations of children living far from their close relatives. These locations informed her of potential spots where children were being exploited. For this project, I will use the publicly available data to understand better where migrant children are living and to identify any trends based on country of origin, and across the years as the American political landscape has shifted.


### Data Sources
My main data source comes from the Githhub [(here)](https://github.com/nytimes/hhs-child-migrant-data) NYT published. They provide cleaned data from Jan 2015 - May 2023 of a child's gender and country of origin, date of entrance to the United States, date of release to a sponsor, relationship to that sponsor, and the ZIP code to which the child was released. There are about 550,000 rows.
