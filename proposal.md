*I am between two project ideas, one has cleaned data but has already been widely published, including an [article on visualizations](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/28/us/migrants-children-data.html) of the data, while the other is more novel but would require more cleaning.*

## Option 1: Court Debt Jailings

### Project Description 
A description of your subject area of choice. (1-2 paragraphs)

### Data Sources
My main data source comes from the reproduction materials for "Forgotten but not gone: A multi-state analysis of modern-day debt imprisonment" paper [(Github)](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/debt). The authors provide R/Python code to download the data bulk and tutorials on how to recreate the findings. 


* short description (2-3 sentences)
* estimates of how many rows/columns the source will provide

### Questions

* Should I limit my project to just one state, or would the work be more powerful by including several states?

## Option 2: Unaccompanied Migrant Children

### Project Description 
A description of your subject area of choice. (1-2 paragraphs)

### Data Sources
My main data source comes from the Githhub [(here)](https://github.com/nytimes/hhs-child-migrant-data) NYT published. They provide cleaned data from Jan 2015 - May 2023 of a child's gender and country of origin, date of entrance to the United States, date of release to a sponsor, relationship to that sponsor, and the ZIP code to which the child was released. There are about 550,000 rows.
