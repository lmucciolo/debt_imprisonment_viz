# Project Name

Livia Mucciolo

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
I envision my final deliverable to either be an article incorporating the images or an infographic. I am leaning towards the latter, as I feel it would add novelty, since my data is coming from a published research article already.
